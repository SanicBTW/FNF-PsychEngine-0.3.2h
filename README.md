# Psych 0.3.2h with Android features for mod ports

Tried my best to make it more vanilla but I really can't because I removed a couple of things:

- Lua stuff (0.3.2h lua, not really important I guess)
- Story Menu State (who uses this though)
- Achievements (I personally dont like them)
- Reset score substate

You can add these again in your fork or repo if you want

# This branch its vanilla and stable, other branches adds extra functionalities to the engine

The branches can be up to date with the base engine or be in an old version

This branch is asset based and doesn't have any file system compatibility
