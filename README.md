# Psych Engine 0.3.2h - HXS-Forever Branch

## This branch focuses on porting "Forever Engine" WIP Rewrite Modding system to Psych Engine

- Q: Why not Lua? Lua is coming all the way from 0.3.2h probably and supports more mods from Psych
- A: Well I wanted to make this actually different from every other fork, maybe there is a fork about adding advanced hscript  support to the latest Psych version but I wanted to test out if I could port more Forever stuff into Psych
